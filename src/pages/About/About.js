              <p>
                Hello! I'm Aanand Mahawal, a passionate and driven undergraduate
                pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and
                Communication Engineering at NIT Kurukshetra. Hailing from
                Palwal, Haryana, Iâ€™ve always been captivated by the
                ever-evolving world of technology. Over time, my curiosity has
                led me to discover a strong passion for coding and web
                development, where creativity meets logic. I take pride in being
                a keen learner, constantly exploring new tools, frameworks, and
                technologies to refine my skills and stay ahead in this dynamic
                field. Whether it's building interactive web applications or
                diving deep into the logic behind a piece of code, I find joy in
                solving problems and bringing ideas to life.
